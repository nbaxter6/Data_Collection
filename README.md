# Data_Collection
This repository contains two jupyter files and a csv. 

Part 1 of this challenge demonstrates how to use BeautifulSoup to scrape information from a website. In this case, the website is the Mars News Site (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html), and the information collected were the titles and description summaries of articles. 

Part 2 of this challenge takes information scraped from "Mars Tempurature Data Site" (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) and uses matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations of the data.
